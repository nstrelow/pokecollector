// ─── Linked pan/zoom comparison ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Full-screen look at a candidate next to the user's own photo where we have
// it. Comparing the two at real size is the decision the reviewer is
// actually making, so the modal shows both rather than the candidate alone.
//
// With `matches` supplied this becomes the review surface itself: arrow keys
// step through the candidates for one photo, and accepting hands the chosen
// card to the add modal. Without them it is just a zoom, which is what
// clicking the photo thumbnail does.
//
// Both halves of the comparison live in an identically sized frame, and each
// image is contained within it. Two reasons it is the frame that carries the
// size rather than the image:
//
//   * a low-resolution stand-in would otherwise decide its own layout from
//     its ~245px intrinsic width, and the candidate would render a third the
//     size of the photo beside it;
//   * a phone photo and a catalogue scan are never quite the same shape, so
//     sizing each image independently leaves the two cards misaligned —
//     which defeats the point of showing them side by side.
//
// Give both sides one real card-shaped viewport instead of two loose boxes.
// The old max-width/max-height combination let a 3:4 phone photo and a
// catalogue scan settle at different rendered heights. A 5:7 viewport keeps
// their visible edges aligned; object-cover only trims the small amount of
// background/crop variance outside that shared card ratio.
//
// On phones the comparison stacks, but both figures still need to fit in
// the visible modal without scrolling. Dynamic viewport height is therefore
// the primary bound there; the result is still meaningfully larger than a
// half-width side-by-side card. From the tablet breakpoint onward the same
// figures sit side by side. A photo-only viewer can use considerably more
// space because it has no comparison sibling.
