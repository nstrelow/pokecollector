# Architecture Overview

This document reflects the current code layout at the repository root.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology | Port |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS | 3000 |
| Backend | FastAPI | 8000 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 18 | 5432 |
| External APIs | TCGdex, Gemini or OpenAI-compatible scanner, Frankfurter, GitHub | external |
| Containerization | Docker + docker compose | - |

The table lists the default published host ports, set with `FRONTEND_PORT` and `BACKEND_PORT`. Inside the Compose network the frontend listens on `80`, the backend on `8000`, and PostgreSQL on `5432` without being published.

Removed from the current architecture:

- no `backend/api/ebay.py`
- no `services/notifications.py`
- no old nested `pokemon-tcg-collection/` directory

## Backend Architecture

### Router Registration

`backend/main.py` registers feature routers under `/api/*`.

Important modules added since the older docs:

- `api/auth.py`
- `api/github.py`
- `api/images.py`
- `api/products.py`

### Data Model

Key ORM models in `backend/models.py`:

- `Set`
- `Card`
- `User`
- `CollectionItem`
- `WishlistItem`
- `Binder`
- `BinderCard`
- `ProductPurchase`
- `SyncLog`
- `PortfolioSnapshot`
- `Setting`
- `UserSetting`
- `CustomCardMatch`
- `ImageCache`
- `ScanJob`
- `ScanJobItem`
- `ScanQueueUserState`
- `GeminiQuotaState`
- `ScannerProviderLimitState`

Notable current model rules:

- `Set.id` and `Card.id` are composite ids with TCGdex language suffixes, including multi-part codes such as `zh-tw` and `pt-br`
- `Card.rarity` comes from TCGdex and is treated as read-only metadata
- Card data, image, and price fallback source languages are tagged when English exact-ID fallback data is used
- Collection variants are limited to physical print variants
- Wishlist items store requested quantity from `1` to `99`
- `User.must_change_password` drives the forced password change flow
- `UserSetting` stores per-user preferences and secrets

## Settings Architecture

Settings are split between two stores:

- Global `settings` table
- Per-user `user_settings` table

The split is defined in `backend/api/settings.py`:

- `PER_USER_KEYS`
  - language
  - currency
  - price display preferences
  - Telegram keys and alert preferences
  - Gemini/OpenAI-compatible provider keys and provider-specific scanner choices
  - scanner diagnostics consent
  - trainer name
- `ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`
  - full sync interval
  - price sync interval
  - multi-user mode
  - TCGdex sync languages

Effectively:

- normal users can only change their own per-user settings
- admins can also change global operational settings
- per-user settings isolation is enforced in the API layer
- `tcgdex_sync_languages` controls which TCGdex set/card languages full sync fetches. It defaults to `en,de`; extra languages are optional because they increase sync time, API calls, and database size.
- Invalid or empty `TCGDEX_SYNC_LANGUAGES` env values fall back safely to `en,de` during first bootstrap; the env value `all` expands to every supported TCGdex language
- App UI language selection is separate from TCGdex sync-language selection. The UI selector includes all supported TCGdex language codes plus Swedish.

## Authentication Architecture

Authentication lives in:

- `backend/api/auth.py`
- `backend/services/auth.py`
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

Current auth model:

- Single-user mode returns the admin user from `get_current_user()` when no token is present
- Multi-user mode requires JWT authentication
- `/api/auth/mode` exposes whether the app is in single-user or multi-user mode
- `must_change_password` is returned by `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/me`
- The frontend blocks protected routes until forced password change is completed

## Scanner Flow

Recognition is implemented in `backend/api/recognize.py` and surfaced through `frontend/src/components/UnifiedCardScanner.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/ScanQueue.jsx`, and the shared add/review components.

Current flow:

1. The user captures or uploads up to 50 photos. Uploads are size-limited, re-encoded, orientation-normalized, stripped of metadata, and stored as private JPEG files.
2. Single photos run individually. Batch-eligible photos are grouped into two-to-four-card composites to reduce provider calls; uncertain composite positions fall back to their original individual photo.
3. The selected Gemini or OpenAI-compatible provider extracts name, split collector number, printed total, set code, regulation mark, type, HP, language, and artist. Unclear small text must be returned as `null`.
4. Candidates are searched against the locally synced `cards` table in the detected language with English fallback. Substring results from either the local catalogue or live TCGdex must still match the complete recognized name after accent, case, and whitespace normalization, preventing collisions such as `Mew`/`Mewtwo` or differing card suffixes from becoming confident number matches. A search pair falls back to a live TCGdex call when it finds no name-compatible local rows, or when a collector number was recognized but none of those rows has that number. This covers both entirely new card names and new printings of existing names while the local sync is behind or still in progress. The fallback result is used for that scan only and is not written back to the catalogue. If every required fallback is unavailable and there is no local candidate, the scan reports a catalogue outage rather than completing with no matches. Candidates from either source are then ranked deterministically by local number, language, printed total, set code, regulation mark, artist, and HP. Missing fields are neutral; contradictions reduce rank.
5. When metadata remains inconclusive, conservative pHash compares the original photo with a bounded candidate set. It accepts only a close, clearly separated winner with no metadata contradiction.
6. Individual scans may use a second provider visual comparison if pHash abstains. Composite scans instead return to the individual queue path. OpenAI-compatible selections must prove their configured endpoint/model before scanning. Models that pass only the single-image probe may be saved by an administrator in acknowledged limited mode, which disables the second visual-comparison step.
7. Results are persisted in the `/scans` review inbox. Confirming or dismissing an item deletes its queued photo; unresolved jobs expire after 14 days. Resolved items stay in the review payload (collapsed to a compact row) rather than disappearing, so a reviewer working through a batch can still see what they just confirmed; the separate inbox-list endpoint still excludes fully-resolved jobs. The review UI lets a reviewer pan and zoom a candidate against their own photo, and accepting a match from that view automatically opens the next unresolved photo in the job.

`backend/services/scan_queue.py` provides fair, restart-safe background dispatch with leases. Recognition attempts are capped separately from transient quota failures. Parsed vision results are stored under the active lease before catalogue matching and reused only for catalogue-outage retries, avoiding repeated paid extraction while TCGdex is unavailable; other failure paths discard this temporary cache. Gemini shares quota state by its existing API-key fingerprint so upgrades preserve active pacing and quota blocks. Compatible providers persist blocks under a fingerprint keyed with the resolved private server secret, without storing credentials or administrator endpoint text. Structured daily-quota signals are separated from short-term limits, and provider `Retry-After` / `google.rpc.RetryInfo` delays take precedence over fallback backoff.

### Offline recognition ("Scanner v2 (Beta)")

Each user may switch their scans to offline recognition with the **Scanner v2 (Beta)** toggle in Scanner Settings, stored per user as `local_scanner_enabled` (default off, `backend/services/local_scanner.py`). While it is on, both the direct scan and every queued photo are matched by `backend/api/recognize_local.py` against perceptual hashes of the locally stored catalogue artwork: no provider is contacted, no API key is needed, and no card name is read. Steps 2–6 above are skipped entirely — staged groups are matched one photo at a time rather than composited, because a frame holding several cards is the case the card detector cannot box. Matches carry `_distance` and a coarse `_confidence` that the review shortlist labels.

The toggle can only be switched on once `GET /api/cards/recognize/local/status` reports `ready` (enough of the catalogue fingerprinted); it can always be switched back off. If the index stops being ready afterwards, queued scans retry transiently rather than failing, and resume when the hourly backfill catches up. Because artwork alone carries no text, printings that differ only by language cannot be told apart and are left for the user to pick from the shortlist — the shortlist therefore shows one tile per *artwork*, with a card's other language printings grouped onto that tile rather than spending a slot each.

Uploads are downscaled in the browser to the same 2048px longest edge the backend applies anyway (`frontend/src/utils/scannerImages.js`), which cut a 12MP phone photo from 2.09MB to 0.47MB across a 37-photo sample — 77% less over the wire, for one extra JPEG generation that left 36 of 37 perceptual hashes bit-identical. It is best effort: an unsupported codec, a missing canvas or a resize that came out larger all fall back to sending the original. It deliberately does **not** crop to the card, because the backend's detector is what every accuracy figure was measured against and a second implementation would have to agree with it pixel for pixel.

The status endpoint reports two fractions and they are not interchangeable: `coverage` is over cards that have artwork (the backfill's progress, and what readiness is judged on) while `catalogue_coverage` is over every indexable card. They read 97% and 76% on a full catalogue, because roughly a fifth of cards have a name and a number and no picture at all and no image method can ever match them. The settings card shows the second.

#### The optional accurate path

`backend/services/card_embedding.py` adds a dense image embedding alongside the perceptual hash, stored in `cards.image_embedding` with its own provenance in `cards.image_embedding_source`. It is **off unless explicitly enabled** and adds no required dependency:

```
pip install onnxruntime
LOCAL_SCANNER_MODEL=/models/dinov2-small.onnx   # facebook/dinov2-small, Apache-2.0, exported to ONNX
```

With it off, nothing changes and `onnxruntime` is never imported. With it on, the hourly backfill computes the embedding from the image it already downloads (no extra request to TCGdex), the index whitens the vectors to 256 dimensions at load time, and a scan is ranked by a per-query z-score sum of the embedding's cosine similarity and the hash's Hamming distance — the hash is kept because two language printings of one card are different renders, which is exactly the distinction the embedding cannot make. A row that has no embedding yet is ranked on its hash alone, so the two coexist while a backfill catches up.

Measured against the same 42,254-card index and 7,098 degraded photographs, the shortlist finds the right artwork 99.93% of the time against the hash's 90.67%, and 6 of 6 ground-truthed real phone photographs against the hash's 2. Against 87 real photographs through the deployed endpoint the median scan is 972 ms and every one is ranked by the embedding; the honest caveats on that run are in the benchmark notes, and the largest is that a card whose set holds no artwork is still answered confidently rather than refused. It costs ~70MB of site-packages, an 88MB model (24MB quantised), ~22MB of resident index, and takes a scan from ~117ms to ~540ms. **The confidence gate is not calibrated for it**, so while it is active the scanner never claims an identity outright — `MIN_MARGIN` is a number of bits measured on a hash-ordered shortlist and means nothing on a fused one. The shortlist is the answer until a margin on the fused score has been derived.

Optional diagnostics live in `backend/services/scan_trace.py`. The server must set `SCAN_TRACE_DIR`, and each user must separately enable **Share scanner diagnostics** (off by default). Only opted-in attempts store a sanitized photo plus structured extraction/search/ranking data, including provider and model identifiers. Turning the toggle off stops future traces without deleting old ones; the adjacent delete action removes that user's trace subtree. `SCAN_TRACE_STORAGE_DIR` remains stable when collection is disabled so explicit and account deletion can still find old data. Account deletion writes a revocation marker before cleanup so an in-flight attempt cannot recreate the deleted user's files. No provider key or authentication credential is recorded.

## Frontend State

Current frontend state layers:

- Server state: TanStack Query
- Auth state: `AuthContext`
- Settings and i18n state: `SettingsContext`
- Local UI state: component-level `useState`
- Theme state: `useTheme` with `data-theme` and local storage

`AuthContext` is now a core part of the app architecture, not an optional enhancement.

## Navigation Architecture

- `HomeScreen.jsx` is the compact portal entry point
- `Layout.jsx` wraps protected routes
- `AppNav.jsx` provides the page title strip and logout affordance
- `TabNav.jsx` is the shared section tab component used across major screens

## Integrations

### TCGdex

- Set and card source of truth
- Variant availability flags come from TCGdex
- Rarity is read from TCGdex and shown read-only
- Supported sync languages are centralized in `backend/services/tcgdex_languages.py`
- English is the preferred fallback for missing data, images, and prices only when the same exact TCGdex card or set ID exists in English
- Regional-only cards are not guessed by translated name

### Scanner providers

- Gemini is the default; administrators may also enable hosted or self-hosted OpenAI-compatible providers
- Provider communication is isolated behind one shared scanner-provider layer, while matching, visual verification, queueing, and warnings remain provider-neutral
- Users choose only administrator-approved providers and models; administrators can test an Advanced custom model before saving it
- OpenAI-compatible provider/model selections must pass the real-image capability probe; an administrator may explicitly accept single-image-only limited mode, while Gemini keeps its established automatic verification behavior
- Credentials are read per user from `user_settings`; endpoints and approved models remain administrator-controlled
- Transient capacity failures are retried; rate limits, invalid keys, unavailable models, and permanent request failures are reported separately without reflecting arbitrary upstream messages

### Telegram

- Implemented in `backend/services/telegram.py`
- Service accepts `user_id` so alerts use that user's Telegram credentials

### GitHub / Community

- `backend/api/github.py` fetches contributors from the GitHub API
- `backend/api/community.py` is the only client of the versioned public supporter registry at `pokecollector.romerg.de`
- Supporter responses are size-bounded and strictly validated before use; unknown fields, unsafe values, malformed responses, redirects, and upstream failures are rejected
- Supporter data is not persisted or served from a fallback. The Community view fetches on each entry, retains only an in-memory browser cache between entries, and hides cached data while that fetch is pending or after it fails; there is no recurring polling
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` renders contributors and the validated supporter projection in the Community section

## Security Notes

- Sync endpoints are admin-only
- Backup and restore are admin-only
- Settings keys are separated into admin-only and per-user scopes
- Frontend logout clears local storage and forces a full reload to avoid leaking cached user data across sessions
- User deletion explicitly removes owned rows from collection, wishlist, binders, products, portfolio snapshots, and user settings before deleting the user

## Migration Notes

Schema changes are handled by idempotent SQL in `backend/database.py`, not Alembic.

Some migration comments still mention historical features, but the current runtime architecture does not include eBay integration and does not expose grading in the active UI or ORM model.
