| GET | `/api/cards/recognize/jobs/{job_id}/items/{item_id}/matcher` | External matcher debug blob for one item (response minus candidates) + artefact URLs; 404 for LLM scans |
| GET | `/api/cards/recognize/jobs/{job_id}/items/{item_id}/matcher/{plane\|overlay}.webp` | Rectified card / overlay: the stored diagnostics copy, else fetched from the matcher's trace store; 404 when neither exists |

`GET /api/cards/search` accepts `q` (with `name` as a compatibility alias),
`number`, `set_id`, `type`, `category`, `subtype`, `rarity`, `artist`,
`rule_text`, `hp_min`, `hp_max`, `dex_id`, `lang`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`,
`page`, and `page_size`. Text filters are accent-insensitive. `rule_text`
searches card effects plus attack/ability names and effects. Card numbers use
the same leading-zero and alphanumeric matching as exact lookup, and `q` also
recognizes code-number pairs such as `PFL 001`.

Custom cards belong to exactly one user. Owners may publish a card as a shared template, but other users must clone it before using it in collections, wishlists, binders, products, or trades. Clones have independent IDs, metadata, images, and prices. Manual image URLs must use public HTTPS destinations and are fetched through the size-limited image proxy. During upgrade, existing custom cards become shared templates owned by the first-created admin account, while each other referencing user receives one private clone and keeps their existing references.

## Models

### `Card`

- Composite primary key: `{tcg_card_id}_{lang}`, for example `sv1-1_de`
- `tcg_card_id` stores the original TCGdex card id
- `set_id` stores the original TCGdex set id, not the composite set row id
- `rarity` is read-only API data
- Variant availability is represented by boolean flags:
  - `variants_normal`
  - `variants_reverse`
  - `variants_holo`
  - `variants_first_edition`

### `CollectionItem`

- Stores user-owned copies of cards
- Active fields: `card_id`, `user_id`, `quantity`, `condition`, `variant`, `purchase_price`, `lang`
- Variant values are now the physical print variants only: `Normal`, `Holo`, `Reverse Holo`, `First Edition`
- The old grading UI is gone; the database migration history still contains a legacy `grade` column, but it is not part of the current ORM model or API schema
- Existing rows are grouped by user, card, variant, language, condition,
  purchase price, and normalized printing-detail tag set when cards are added
  through the API
- `printing_detail_tags` adds reusable owner-scoped descriptors without expanding
  the fixed physical-variant enum

### `CollectionCardPhoto` and `PrintingDetailTag`

- `CollectionCardPhoto` stores one private image per `user_id + card_id`; all
  grouped collection rows for that card identity share it
- Photo bytes are returned only through authenticated collection endpoints and
  never written to the globally visible catalogue-card image cache
- `PrintingDetailTag` is unique per user after Unicode normalization and a
  fixed digest key
- The same tag may be associated with collection items, product cards, product
  ledger entries, and trade items

### `Binder` / `BinderCard`

- `binder_type` is `collection`, `wishlist`, `deck`, or `physical_deck`
- Planned rows store `card_id + required_quantity`; physical rows add an exact
  `collection_item_id`
- `target_size`, when present, is 20, 40, or 60
- `is_public` applies to collection Binders and Decks exposed through public profiles
- Allocation services enforce one shared owned-copy capacity across physical
  Binders and Real Decks

### Public sharing boundary

- `User.wishlist_visibility` is constrained to `private`, `trade_matches`, or
  `public`; migrations normalize every existing row to `private`
- anonymous serializers query catalogue cards directly and exclude Wishlist
  alert state, notification history, collection ownership, physical allocation,
  purchase, condition, private-photo, and internal-row data
- private custom cards are excluded from public Wishlists and block Deck sharing
- every successful anonymous response requires the global feature, a live public
  owner profile, and the relevant Wishlist or Card List opt-in; responses require
  cache revalidation so revocation takes effect immediately

### Products and trades

- `ProductPurchase` tracks batch, image/Cardmarket links, notes, and lifecycle
  state (`sealed`, `opened`, `sold`, or `review`)
- `ProductCard` links opened-product contents to source collection rows while
  retaining initial, active, and sold quantities
- `ProductLedgerEntry` preserves realized sales, gains, adjustments, and trade
  outflow history even if an active collection row is later removed
- `Trade` records partner/date/notes, cash-adjusted incoming/outgoing values,
  and value delta
- `TradeItem` stores direction and a card/condition/variant/language/printing
  snapshot plus provenance used to safely edit newer trades

### `User`

- Fields include `role`, `avatar_id`, and `must_change_password`
- `must_change_password` is returned by auth responses and enforced by the frontend after login

### `Setting`

- Global key/value table
- Used for admin-only settings such as sync cadence and auth mode

### `UserSetting`

- Per-user key/value table
- Used for isolated user preferences and secrets
- Unique constraint: `user_id + key`

### Other Core Models

- `Set`
- `WishlistItem`
- `PriceHistory`
- `PortfolioSnapshot`
- `SyncLog`
- `ImageCache`
- `CustomCardMatch`
- `ScanJob` / `ScanJobItem` / `ScanQueueUserState`
- `GeminiQuotaState` / `ScannerProviderLimitState`

## Settings Scope

Current settings are split in `backend/api/settings.py`:

- `PER_USER_KEYS`
  - `language`
  - `currency`
  - `price_primary`
  - `price_display`
  - `telegram_bot_token`
  - `telegram_chat_id`
  - `telegram_enabled`
  - `price_alerts_enabled`
  - `price_alert_threshold`
  - `gemini_api_key`
  - `openai_api_key`
  - provider-specific scanner provider/model settings managed by the dedicated scanner endpoint
  - `scan_diagnostics_enabled`
  - `prefer_own_card_photos`
  - `set_overview_filters`
  - `hidden_set_ids`
  - `portfolio_display_mode`
  - provider-specific request timeouts, custom-model selections, capability
    proofs, and optional Gemini fallback preference
  - `trainer_name`
- `ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`
  - `full_sync_interval_days`
  - `price_sync_interval_minutes`
  - `multi_user_mode`
  - `tcgdex_sync_languages`
  - `debug_mode`
  - `cross_language_price_fallback`
  - `cross_language_image_fallback`
  - `tcgdex_digital_sets_enabled`
  - `public_profiles_enabled`

Important behavior:

- Each user only reads and writes their own `UserSetting` rows
- Admin-only settings are stored globally in `settings`
- Recurring automatic syncs include a full sync cadence and a separate small price sync cadence
- `tcgdex_sync_languages` is seeded from `TCGDEX_SYNC_LANGUAGES` only when the row does not exist yet; afterward the DB value is authoritative. Empty or invalid env values safely fall back to `en,de`. The env value `all` expands to every supported TCGdex language during first bootstrap.
- Supported TCGdex sync language codes are centralized in `services/tcgdex_languages.py`. Optional extra languages are `fr`, `es`, `es-mx`, `it`, `pt`, `pt-br`, `pt-pt`, `nl`, `pl`, `ru`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-tw`, `id`, `th`, and `zh-cn` in addition to the default `en,de`.
- English is the preferred cross-language fallback source for missing data, images, and prices by exact TCGdex ID. The backend does not guess English replacements by card name for regional-only cards.
- Admin users can receive initial fallback values from env vars for Telegram and Gemini
- `recognize.py` intentionally reads Gemini only from the current user's `UserSetting`; there is no cross-user fallback
- `scan_diagnostics_enabled` is off by default and is effective only when the server configures `SCAN_TRACE_DIR`

## Sync & Backup Behavior

### Sync

- `/api/sync/`, `/api/sync/prices`, and `/api/sync/prices/all` enforce admin access
- `/api/sync/` runs the full TCGdex set/card sync using the configured `tcgdex_sync_languages`
- `/api/sync/prices` runs the small tracked-card price sync
- `/api/sync/prices/all` force-refreshes prices for all tracked cards
- Sync status returns current flags plus the last 10 sync log rows
- Full sync and price sync can be rescheduled through dedicated endpoints

### Selective Backup

`GET /api/backup/download` accepts `include` as a comma-separated query param.

Supported groups:

- `full`
- `collection`
- `users`
- `cards`
- `products`
- `system`
- `images`

Current table mapping:

- `collection`: `collection`, `wishlist`, `binders`, `binder_cards`,
  `printing_detail_tags`, `collection_printing_detail_tags`
- `users`: `users`, `user_settings`, `settings`, `printing_detail_tags`
- `cards`: `cards`, `sets`, `price_history`, `custom_card_matches`
- `products`: `product_purchases`, `product_cards`, `product_ledger_entries`,
  `portfolio_snapshots`, `printing_detail_tags`,
  `product_card_printing_detail_tags`, `product_ledger_printing_detail_tags`
- `system`: `sync_log`
- `images`: `image_cache`

If `include=full`, image cache is excluded unless `images` is also explicitly included.

Use `full` for disaster recovery. Selective mappings are targeted export groups,
not guaranteed standalone restore sets: they may depend on rows in another
group and currently do not include every independent newer table, including
trades, trade-item tag associations, private collection-card photos, and scan
queue/provider state. A full dump includes those database tables. Scanner trace
and queued-photo files remain filesystem data and are not part of SQL backups.

### Manual restore

`POST /api/backup/restore` accepts only a non-empty `.sql` upload, streams it to
a temporary file, and invokes `psql` with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`, `--no-psqlrc`, and
`--single-transaction`. Any SQL error rolls back the whole restore. The
temporary file is removed whether the operation succeeds or fails.

### Automatic Pre-upgrade Backup

The backend image installs PostgreSQL 18 client tools so `pg_dump` can back up the default PostgreSQL 18 service and newer external PostgreSQL 18 servers. PostgreSQL requires `pg_dump` to be at least as new as the server major version.

`backend/services/pre_upgrade_backup.py` runs before `init_db()` startup migrations.

Behavior:

- Reads the current app version from `VERSION` through `backend/main.py`.
- Reads `settings.last_successful_app_version` from the existing database.
- Skips fresh installs where the `settings` table does not exist yet.
- Creates a full SQL dump in `/app/backups` when an existing install starts on a new version.
- Uses filenames like `pre_upgrade_1.17.0_to_1.18.0_20260526_010500.sql`.
- Records `last_successful_app_version` only after startup initialization succeeds.
- Retains the newest `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_KEEP` automatic backups, default `10`, minimum `1`.
- Writes dumps to a temporary filename first, then atomically renames after a successful non-empty `pg_dump` so partial files are not treated as valid backups.

Environment controls:

- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_ENABLED`, default `true`
- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_REQUIRED`, default `true`; when true, startup fails before migrations if `pg_dump` fails
- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_KEEP`, default `10`, minimum `1`

## Scanner Notes

`backend/api/recognize.py`, `backend/api/scan_jobs.py`, and `backend/services/scan_queue.py` implement the persistent background queue used by the unified scanner. The direct single-card recognition endpoint remains available for API compatibility:

1. Uploads are bounded, sanitized, orientation-normalized JPEGs with metadata removed.
2. Two-to-four batch-eligible photos share one indexed composite provider request. Any missing or uncertain position is retried from its original individual photo.
3. The selected provider extracts name, split local/total collector number, printed set code, regulation mark, type, HP, language, and artist; uncertain small text stays `null`.
4. Candidates are found by querying the locally synced `cards` table and ranked deterministically by local number, language, printed total, set code, regulation mark, artist, and HP. Missing evidence is neutral and contradictions are negative. Broad substring rows from either the local catalogue or live TCGdex are retained only when their complete names match after accent, case, and whitespace normalization, so an unrelated containing name or different card suffix cannot become a confident number match. A (language, name) search pair falls back to one live TCGdex call (`_api_search_fallback` in `backend/api/recognize.py`) when it has no name-compatible local rows, or when a collector number was recognized but none of those rows has that number. The second condition matters when a newly released printing reuses an existing card name before the local sync reaches it. The fallback result is used for that one scan only and is never persisted to `cards`. When every required live fallback is unavailable and no local candidate exists, the scan reports a transient catalogue outage instead of a false "no matches" result. Queued scans save the parsed vision result before matching and reuse it for catalogue-outage retries, so recovery does not repeat the paid extraction. Scan traces tag each search-pair result's `source` as `local` or `api_fallback`, and cached retries mark the extraction source as `queue_cache`.
5. If metadata is inconclusive, conservative pHash can accept a close, clearly separated visual winner without another provider call. It never overrides known contradictions.
6. Individual scans may use the same provider's visual comparison when pHash abstains; composite scans fall back to individual recognition instead.
7. Queue results remain reviewable after restarts. Confirming and adding a
   candidate uses one row-locked database transaction so concurrent tabs cannot
   increment the collection twice. The frontend retains the source Blob before
   that request; when no catalogue/custom artwork exists, it uploads the Blob
   afterward as a best-effort authenticated collection-card photo. Failure does
   not undo the collection add. Confirming/dismissing deletes the queued photo.
   Unreviewed jobs expire after 14 days.

Provider error handling:

- Gemini and OpenAI-compatible providers share the queue contract while retaining provider-specific request formats
- Permanent authentication, billing, model, and request errors stop immediately with fixed actionable messages; arbitrary upstream prose is not returned, logged, or persisted
- Transient provider failures are retried with bounded backoff
- Machine-readable daily-quota `429` responses are separated from short-term limits
- Provider `Retry-After` or `google.rpc.RetryInfo` delays are used exactly when supplied; missing daily delays fall back to one hour and later six-hour intervals
- Quota state is shared by an API-key fingerprint, so concurrent requests using the same key observe one block while different keys stay independent
- Quota retries do not consume the three recognition attempts
- Invalid API keys get a dedicated user-facing message
- Provider defaults and approved models are administrator-controlled; normal users select only enabled choices, while administrators may test an Advanced custom model
- Retired or unavailable models return a fixed model-unavailable message without reflecting provider text
- Temporary Gemini outages are returned clearly instead of leaking as generic backend `500` errors
- Gemini requests send the API key via header instead of the request URL

Additional matching behavior:

- Name suffixes like `EX`, `GX`, `V`, `VMAX`, `VSTAR`, `TAG TEAM`, `BREAK`, and `LV.X` are stripped before search
- Search may fall back from detected card language to English
- Result payload includes recognized metadata and candidate matches, each flagged with `printed_total_mismatch` when its printed set total contradicts the recognized card (the same signal the ranker already uses to demote it)
- `backend/services/scan_candidate_images.py` caches each unresolved review's full-resolution candidate artwork in the shared `ImageCache` table (see `backend/api/images.py`); `match_card_info` fires a bounded, non-blocking prewarm of the top-ranked candidates so the review UI's first look is usually a local cache read. Fetches accept only image responses from the TCGdex HTTPS CDN, and this feature's cache entries are capped.

### External card matcher

`backend/services/external_matcher.py` implements provider `external`, enabled
when `EXTERNAL_MATCHER_URL` is set (see `docs/scanner-providers.md` for the
contract). It is not an LLM, so the queue path is different:

- `default_scan_processor` posts the photo to `/identify` (with the job's
  `session_lang` and `debug=1`), skips text extraction and `match_card_info`,
  and maps candidates with `to_matches()` to the normal match shape
  (`id = <tcg_card_id>_<lang>`, local catalogue image when the row exists, else
  the `/api/cards/recognize/matcher/ref/...` proxy). `recognized` has every text
  field `null` except `language`, plus `_source="external"`,
  `_identity_decision` (matcher state) and `_identity_confident`.
- The matcher's full response minus candidates is stored in
  `scan_job_items.matcher_result` and served by `GET .../items/{item}/matcher`;
  the item payload only carries `has_matcher`.
- Failures: connection refused / 502–504 ⇒ transient retry with backoff
  (`retry_reason="matcher_unavailable"`, `Retry-After` honoured); timeout
  (`EXTERNAL_MATCHER_TIMEOUT`) or 4xx ⇒ the item fails with the message;
  malformed answers / other 5xx ⇒ the normal three recognition attempts.
- Composite (grid) jobs are never created for `external`, and
  `default_composite_processor` returns every position unresolved so an older
  batch is requeued per photo.
- No capability proof is required (`scanner_capability_mode` returns `full`);
  Scanner Settings' Test runs `/health`.
- With diagnostics enabled, the trace JSON gains `matcher` (full response) and
  `session_lang`, and the matcher's `plane`/`overlay` webps are stored beside the
  sanitized JPEG as `<stem>.plane.webp` / `<stem>.overlay.webp` (best effort).

### Scanner diagnostics

`backend/services/scan_trace.py` is disabled unless `SCAN_TRACE_DIR` points to storage the backend can create and write. Availability alone does not collect data: each user must opt in with `scan_diagnostics_enabled=true`, which is off by default. `SCAN_TRACE_STORAGE_DIR` is the stable cleanup location; standard Docker Compose keeps it at `/app/data/scan-traces` even when new collection is disabled.

For opted-in attempts, one user-scoped JSON trace and sanitized JPEG are stored. Traces contain the selected provider and model, generic prompt, redacted provider response, parsed fields and usage, TCGdex searches, ranked candidates and rank keys, pHash distances, visual-verification response, final mechanism, and errors. Configured credentials are redacted before persistence and are never returned by the settings API.

When a queued candidate is confirmed, its TCGdex card id labels all stored attempts for that job item as ground truth. `backend/scripts/analyse_scan_traces.py` reports top-1 accuracy, retrieval/ranking misses, decision-mechanism performance, pHash outcomes, and optional field-null/failure details.

Turning consent off stops future capture and leaves existing traces unchanged. There is no automatic retention limit. `DELETE /api/settings/scan-diagnostics` is the explicit per-user deletion action; deleting an account revokes in-flight writes and removes its trace subtree as well. Trace directories use mode `0700` and JSON/JPEG files use `0600`. Diagnostics are not included in SQL backups because they are filesystem analysis data.

## Bulk Collection Add

`POST /api/collection/bulk-add` accepts `BulkCollectionAddRequest` with multiple `CollectionItemCreate` items and returns `BulkCollectionAddResponse`:

- `added`: new collection rows created
- `updated`: existing matching rows whose quantity was incremented
- `failed`: items that could not be added
- `errors`: per-card error details

Each item is committed independently, so one invalid or unavailable card does not roll back the rest of the batch. Existing rows are matched by card, variant, language, and current user.

## Notifications

`backend/services/telegram.py` now accepts `user_id` and reads Telegram credentials from that user's `UserSetting` rows first.

## Migrations

- Migrations are raw SQL statements in `backend/database.py`
- External matcher: `scan_jobs.session_lang VARCHAR` and `scan_job_items.matcher_result JSON` (both nullable)
- They are idempotent and run on startup
- Automatic pre-upgrade backups run before `init_db()` migrations on existing installs when the app version changes
- Legacy migration comments still mention older columns like `grade` or removed integrations, but the current runtime model and routers do not include eBay functionality
