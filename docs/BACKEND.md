Custom cards belong to exactly one user. Owners may publish a card as a shared template, but other users must clone it before using it in collections, wishlists, binders, products, or trades. Clones have independent IDs, metadata, images, and prices. Manual image URLs must use public HTTPS destinations and are fetched through the size-limited image proxy. During upgrade, existing custom cards become shared templates owned by the first-created admin account, while each other referencing user receives one private clone and keeps their existing references.

## Models

### `Card`

- Composite primary key: `{tcg_card_id}_{lang}`, for example `sv1-1_de`
- `tcg_card_id` stores the original TCGdex card id
- `set_id` stores the original TCGdex set id, not the composite set row id
- `rarity` is read-only API data
- Variant availability is represented by boolean flags:
  - `variants_normal`
  - `variants_reverse`
  - `variants_holo`
  - `variants_first_edition`

### `CollectionItem`

- Stores user-owned copies of cards
- Active fields: `card_id`, `user_id`, `quantity`, `condition`, `variant`, `purchase_price`, `lang`
- Variant values are now the physical print variants only: `Normal`, `Holo`, `Reverse Holo`, `First Edition`
- The old grading UI is gone; the database migration history still contains a legacy `grade` column, but it is not part of the current ORM model or API schema
- Existing rows are grouped by user, card, variant, language, condition, and purchase price when cards are added through the API

### `User`

- Fields include `role`, `avatar_id`, and `must_change_password`
- `must_change_password` is returned by auth responses and enforced by the frontend after login

### `Setting`

- Global key/value table
- Used for admin-only settings such as sync cadence and auth mode

### `UserSetting`

- Per-user key/value table
- Used for isolated user preferences and secrets
- Unique constraint: `user_id + key`

### Other Core Models

- `Set`
- `WishlistItem`
- `Binder` / `BinderCard`
- `ProductPurchase`
- `PriceHistory`
- `PortfolioSnapshot`
- `SyncLog`
- `ImageCache`
- `CustomCardMatch`

## Settings Scope

Current settings are split in `backend/api/settings.py`:

- `PER_USER_KEYS`
  - `language`
  - `currency`
  - `price_primary`
  - `price_display`
  - `telegram_bot_token`
  - `telegram_chat_id`
  - `telegram_enabled`
  - `price_alerts_enabled`
  - `price_alert_threshold`
  - `gemini_api_key`
  - `openai_api_key`
  - provider-specific scanner provider/model settings managed by the dedicated scanner endpoint
  - `scan_diagnostics_enabled`
  - `trainer_name`
- `ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`
  - `full_sync_interval_days`
  - `price_sync_interval_minutes`
  - `multi_user_mode`
  - `tcgdex_sync_languages`
  - `debug_mode`
  - `cross_language_price_fallback`
  - `cross_language_image_fallback`

Important behavior:

- Each user only reads and writes their own `UserSetting` rows
- Admin-only settings are stored globally in `settings`
- Recurring automatic syncs include a full sync cadence and a separate small price sync cadence
- `tcgdex_sync_languages` is seeded from `TCGDEX_SYNC_LANGUAGES` only when the row does not exist yet; afterward the DB value is authoritative. Empty or invalid env values safely fall back to `en,de`. The env value `all` expands to every supported TCGdex language during first bootstrap.
- Supported TCGdex sync language codes are centralized in `services/tcgdex_languages.py`. Optional extra languages are `fr`, `es`, `es-mx`, `it`, `pt`, `pt-br`, `pt-pt`, `nl`, `pl`, `ru`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-tw`, `id`, `th`, and `zh-cn` in addition to the default `en,de`.
- English is the preferred cross-language fallback source for missing data, images, and prices by exact TCGdex ID. The backend does not guess English replacements by card name for regional-only cards.
- Admin users can receive initial fallback values from env vars for Telegram and Gemini
- `recognize.py` intentionally reads Gemini only from the current user's `UserSetting`; there is no cross-user fallback
- `scan_diagnostics_enabled` is off by default and is effective only when the server configures `SCAN_TRACE_DIR`

## Sync & Backup Behavior

### Sync

- `/api/sync/`, `/api/sync/prices`, and `/api/sync/prices/all` enforce admin access
- `/api/sync/` runs the full TCGdex set/card sync using the configured `tcgdex_sync_languages`
- `/api/sync/prices` runs the small tracked-card price sync
- `/api/sync/prices/all` force-refreshes prices for all tracked cards
- Sync status returns current flags plus the last 10 sync log rows
- Full sync and price sync can be rescheduled through dedicated endpoints

### Selective Backup

`GET /api/backup/download` accepts `include` as a comma-separated query param.

Supported groups:

- `full`
- `collection`
- `users`
- `cards`
- `products`
- `system`
- `images`

Current table mapping:

- `collection`: `collection`, `wishlist`, `binders`, `binder_cards`
- `users`: `users`, `user_settings`, `settings`
- `cards`: `cards`, `sets`, `price_history`, `custom_card_matches`
- `products`: `product_purchases`, `portfolio_snapshots`
- `system`: `sync_log`
- `images`: `image_cache`

If `include=full`, image cache is excluded unless `images` is also explicitly included.

### Automatic Pre-upgrade Backup

The backend image installs PostgreSQL 18 client tools so `pg_dump` can back up the default PostgreSQL 18 service and newer external PostgreSQL 18 servers. PostgreSQL requires `pg_dump` to be at least as new as the server major version.

`backend/services/pre_upgrade_backup.py` runs before `init_db()` startup migrations.

Behavior:

- Reads the current app version from `VERSION` through `backend/main.py`.
- Reads `settings.last_successful_app_version` from the existing database.
- Skips fresh installs where the `settings` table does not exist yet.
- Creates a full SQL dump in `/app/backups` when an existing install starts on a new version.
- Uses filenames like `pre_upgrade_1.17.0_to_1.18.0_20260526_010500.sql`.
- Records `last_successful_app_version` only after startup initialization succeeds.
- Retains the newest `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_KEEP` automatic backups, default `10`, minimum `1`.
- Writes dumps to a temporary filename first, then atomically renames after a successful non-empty `pg_dump` so partial files are not treated as valid backups.

Environment controls:

- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_ENABLED`, default `true`
- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_REQUIRED`, default `true`; when true, startup fails before migrations if `pg_dump` fails
- `PRE_UPGRADE_BACKUP_KEEP`, default `10`, minimum `1`

## Scanner Notes

`backend/api/recognize.py`, `backend/api/scan_jobs.py`, and `backend/services/scan_queue.py` implement the persistent background queue used by the unified scanner. The direct single-card recognition endpoint remains available for API compatibility:

1. Uploads are bounded, sanitized, orientation-normalized JPEGs with metadata removed.
2. Two-to-four batch-eligible photos share one indexed composite provider request. Any missing or uncertain position is retried from its original individual photo.
3. The selected provider extracts name, split local/total collector number, printed set code, regulation mark, type, HP, language, and artist; uncertain small text stays `null`.
4. Candidates are found by querying the locally synced `cards` table and ranked deterministically by local number, language, printed total, set code, regulation mark, artist, and HP. Missing evidence is neutral and contradictions are negative. Broad substring rows from either the local catalogue or live TCGdex are retained only when their complete names match after accent, case, and whitespace normalization, so an unrelated containing name or different card suffix cannot become a confident number match. A (language, name) search pair falls back to one live TCGdex call (`_api_search_fallback` in `backend/api/recognize.py`) when it has no name-compatible local rows, or when a collector number was recognized but none of those rows has that number. The second condition matters when a newly released printing reuses an existing card name before the local sync reaches it. The fallback result is used for that one scan only and is never persisted to `cards`. When every required live fallback is unavailable and no local candidate exists, the scan reports a transient catalogue outage instead of a false "no matches" result. Queued scans save the parsed vision result before matching and reuse it for catalogue-outage retries, so recovery does not repeat the paid extraction. Scan traces tag each search-pair result's `source` as `local` or `api_fallback`, and cached retries mark the extraction source as `queue_cache`.
5. If metadata is inconclusive, conservative pHash can accept a close, clearly separated visual winner without another provider call. It never overrides known contradictions.
6. Individual scans may use the same provider's visual comparison when pHash abstains; composite scans fall back to individual recognition instead.
7. Queue results remain reviewable after restarts. Confirming and adding a candidate uses one row-locked database transaction so concurrent tabs cannot increment the collection twice; confirming/dismissing then deletes the queued photo. Unreviewed jobs expire after 14 days.

### Offline recognition ("Scanner v2 (Beta)")

`backend/api/recognize_local.py` is the other route: it matches a photo against
locally stored artwork and never contacts a provider. It is per-user, off by
default (`local_scanner_enabled`), and when on, `services/scan_queue.py` routes
that user's scans to it before any provider work happens — no credential, no
capability probe, no recognition cache.

Two rankers, and which one ran is reported as `_ranked_by` on every answer:

- **Perceptual hash** (`services/card_fingerprint.py`) — a 64-bit DCT hash of
  the artwork in `cards.image_phash`, kept current by an hourly backfill.
  Always available; no dependency beyond numpy and Pillow.
- **Dense embedding** (`services/card_embedding.py`) — optional, enabled only
  by setting `LOCAL_SCANNER_MODEL` to a DINOv2 ONNX export, which also installs
  onnxruntime at build time. Stored in `cards.image_embedding`, whitened to 256
  dimensions at index load, and fused with the hash by a per-query z-score sum.
  The hash is kept because two language printings of one card are the same
  picture to the embedding and different renders to the hash.

A third signal is not a ranker and is listed separately because it does not
score artwork at all:

- **Printed collector number** (`services/card_ocr.py`) — optional, enabled by
  `LOCAL_SCANNER_OCR=1`, which at build time also installs
  `rapidocr-onnxruntime` and `opencv-python-headless` (+311MB). It reads the
  `NNN/TTT` from the bottom of the card and resolves it against
  `sets.printed_total`, joined on `(tcg_set_id, lang)` — deliberately not
  against a set code, which the recogniser reads badly and consistently
  (`DCBL` for a printed `PBL`). A (number, printed total) pair identifies a
  single artwork 64.7% of the time and three or fewer 94% of the time.

  The merge in `_apply_printed_number` is **additive only**: it promotes and
  appends candidates and can never remove one the artwork search found, since
  an OCR misread is at least as likely as a wrong image match. Because it can
  reach cards with no artwork at all — 22% of the catalogue, absent from the
  index entirely — those rows are fetched from the database rather than the
  index snapshot. When it reorders anything, the answer stops claiming
  confidence, because the badge's calibration never saw this evidence. Results
  carry `_printed_numbers`.

  What it buys, A/B'd on one build with the flag as the only variable: on the 24
  real photos whose answer is known, the right card went from 17 to 22 at rank 1
  and from 22 to 24 in the shortlist. One photo regressed — a correctly read
  `19/84` also names a Japanese set with 84 cards, and the wrong one led — which
  is the cost of a number that identifies more than one card. A further 21 of
  the 87 photos now answer with a card that has no artwork at all, unreachable
  by image at any ranker quality; only one of those is ground-truthed.

  It is not free: measured through the deployed endpoint on 87 real photos the
  median scan goes to ~4.3s against ~25ms for the whole fingerprint pipeline,
  and there is no cheap gate to hide it behind, since the embedding path never
  claims confidence anyway. A photo that reads a number is faster than one that
  does not, because failure pays for every framing. On the 25 of those photos
  with a known printed number it read 20 correctly, 5 not at all, and **none
  incorrectly** — the failure mode is silence rather than a confident wrong
  answer, which is what makes reordering on it safe.
  `LOCAL_SCANNER_MODEL_THREADS` caps its onnxruntime pool as well — shared on
  purpose, as both are onnxruntime competing for the same cores.

A row without an embedding is ranked on its hash alone, so the two coexist
while a backfill catches up. If the model is configured but a photo produces no
views, the scan degrades to hash-only and says so in the log and in
`_ranked_by`, because the two rankings are far apart in accuracy.

The shortlist holds twelve distinct **artworks**, not twelve rows: other
language printings of one card are grouped onto its tile in `_other_printings`
rather than spending a slot each. Confidence is judged on the ungrouped
ranking, so collapsing a German and an English printing cannot manufacture a
margin the hash never had.

Known limits, all measured and documented in the benchmark notes: the scanner
cannot separate two language printings by artwork alone; roughly a fifth of the
catalogue has no artwork and can never be matched by image; and a photo of such
a card is still answered confidently rather than refused, because no score in
the system distinguishes "absent" from "hard". The printed-number reader above
is the only signal that addresses the last two, and only when it is enabled and
the number happens to be legible — on an 87-photo real-world set it reads a
number on 75 of them.

Provider error handling:

- Gemini and OpenAI-compatible providers share the queue contract while retaining provider-specific request formats
- Permanent authentication, billing, model, and request errors stop immediately with fixed actionable messages; arbitrary upstream prose is not returned, logged, or persisted
- Transient provider failures are retried with bounded backoff
- Machine-readable daily-quota `429` responses are separated from short-term limits
- Provider `Retry-After` or `google.rpc.RetryInfo` delays are used exactly when supplied; missing daily delays fall back to one hour and later six-hour intervals
- Quota state is shared by an API-key fingerprint, so concurrent requests using the same key observe one block while different keys stay independent
- Quota retries do not consume the three recognition attempts
- Invalid API keys get a dedicated user-facing message
- Provider defaults and approved models are administrator-controlled; normal users select only enabled choices, while administrators may test an Advanced custom model
- Retired or unavailable models return a fixed model-unavailable message without reflecting provider text
- Temporary Gemini outages are returned clearly instead of leaking as generic backend `500` errors
- Gemini requests send the API key via header instead of the request URL

Additional matching behavior:

- Name suffixes like `EX`, `GX`, `V`, `VMAX`, `VSTAR`, `TAG TEAM`, `BREAK`, and `LV.X` are stripped before search
- Search may fall back from detected card language to English
- Result payload includes recognized metadata and candidate matches, each flagged with `printed_total_mismatch` when its printed set total contradicts the recognized card (the same signal the ranker already uses to demote it)
- `backend/services/scan_candidate_images.py` caches each unresolved review's full-resolution candidate artwork in the shared `ImageCache` table (see `backend/api/images.py`); `match_card_info` fires a bounded, non-blocking prewarm of the top-ranked candidates so the review UI's first look is usually a local cache read. Fetches accept only image responses from the TCGdex HTTPS CDN, and this feature's cache entries are capped.

### Scanner diagnostics

`backend/services/scan_trace.py` is disabled unless `SCAN_TRACE_DIR` points to storage the backend can create and write. Availability alone does not collect data: each user must opt in with `scan_diagnostics_enabled=true`, which is off by default. `SCAN_TRACE_STORAGE_DIR` is the stable cleanup location; standard Docker Compose keeps it at `/app/data/scan-traces` even when new collection is disabled.

For opted-in attempts, one user-scoped JSON trace and sanitized JPEG are stored. Traces contain the selected provider and model, generic prompt, redacted provider response, parsed fields and usage, TCGdex searches, ranked candidates and rank keys, pHash distances, visual-verification response, final mechanism, and errors. Configured credentials are redacted before persistence and are never returned by the settings API.

When a queued candidate is confirmed, its TCGdex card id labels all stored attempts for that job item as ground truth. `backend/scripts/analyse_scan_traces.py` reports top-1 accuracy, retrieval/ranking misses, decision-mechanism performance, pHash outcomes, and optional field-null/failure details.

Turning consent off stops future capture and leaves existing traces unchanged. There is no automatic retention limit. `DELETE /api/settings/scan-diagnostics` is the explicit per-user deletion action; deleting an account revokes in-flight writes and removes its trace subtree as well. Trace directories use mode `0700` and JSON/JPEG files use `0600`. Diagnostics are not included in SQL backups because they are filesystem analysis data.

## Bulk Collection Add

`POST /api/collection/bulk-add` accepts `BulkCollectionAddRequest` with multiple `CollectionItemCreate` items and returns `BulkCollectionAddResponse`:

- `added`: new collection rows created
- `updated`: existing matching rows whose quantity was incremented
- `failed`: items that could not be added
- `errors`: per-card error details

Each item is committed independently, so one invalid or unavailable card does not roll back the rest of the batch. Existing rows are matched by card, variant, language, and current user.

## Notifications

`backend/services/telegram.py` now accepts `user_id` and reads Telegram credentials from that user's `UserSetting` rows first.

## Migrations

- Migrations are raw SQL statements in `backend/database.py`
- They are idempotent and run on startup
- Automatic pre-upgrade backups run before `init_db()` migrations on existing installs when the app version changes
- Legacy migration comments still mention older columns like `grade` or removed integrations, but the current runtime model and routers do not include eBay functionality
