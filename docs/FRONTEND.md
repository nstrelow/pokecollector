## Auth Flow

### `AuthContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`.

Responsibilities:

- Fetches `/api/auth/mode` on startup
- In single-user mode, attempts `/api/auth/me` without a token
- In multi-user mode, restores user from stored token if present
- Exposes:
  - `user`
  - `loading`
  - `multiUser`
  - `loginUser(token, userData)`
  - `updateCurrentUser(updates)`
  - `logout()`

Security-related behavior:

- `logout()` removes token and user from local storage
- Logout forces a full page reload to clear cached React Query data and prevent cross-user leakage
- Axios also clears auth state on `401`

### Login and Password Change

- `pages/Login.jsx` is only used when `multiUser === true`
- `App.jsx` defines an inline `ForcePasswordChangeScreen`
- If `user.must_change_password` is true, normal app routes are blocked until `/api/auth/me/force-password` succeeds

## Settings & Localization

### `SettingsContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/SettingsContext.jsx`.

Provides:

- `settings`
- `updateSettings(updates)`
- `t(path)`
- `language`
- `priceDisplay`
- `pricePrimary`
- `pricePrimaryField`
- `currency`
- `currencySymbol`
- `exchangeRate`
- `formatPrice(eurAmount)`
- `formatUsdPrice(usdAmount)`

Notes:

- Translation bundles are loaded from `frontend/src/i18n/` and wired in `SettingsContext`
- UI languages include all supported TCGdex language codes, plus Swedish. Regional variants such as `es-mx`, `pt-br`, `pt-pt`, `zh-tw`, and `zh-cn` are selectable from a compact dropdown in Settings.
- Legacy stored `zh` settings are normalized in the frontend to `zh-cn` for display
- USD display uses exchange rates from the backend Frankfurter endpoint

### `useTheme`

Defined in `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.js`.

- Stores the selected theme in `localStorage`
- Applies theme via `data-theme` on `document.documentElement`
- Available themes:
  - `default`
  - `fire`
  - `water`
  - `grass`
  - `electric`
  - `psychic`
  - `dragon`
  - `dark`
  - `fairy`

## Navigation

### Home / Portal Navigation

- `pages/HomeScreen.jsx` is the main portal view
- The app now uses a compact navigation pattern with 6 primary portal items on the home screen
- Secondary sections are organized with grouped tabs on individual pages

### `TabNav`

Defined in `frontend/src/components/TabNav.jsx`.

- Reusable horizontal tab bar
- Marks a tab active if the current pathname equals or starts with the tab path
- Used by pages such as `Dashboard`, `Collection`, `Wishlist`, `Binders`, `Analytics`, `Products`, `Leaderboard`, and `Achievements`

### `Layout` and `AppNav`

- `components/Layout.jsx` wraps protected routes
- `components/AppNav.jsx` shows the current page title and multi-user logout control

## Key Screens

### `pages/Login.jsx`

- Multi-user login screen
- Supports quick return to the last signed-in user via `lastUser` and `lastUserAvatar` in local storage

### `pages/Leaderboard.jsx`

- Social ranking view for multi-user mode
- Uses `TabNav`

### `pages/Compare.jsx`

- Side-by-side trainer comparison
- Route parameter: `userId`

### `pages/Achievements.jsx`

- Shows achievements for current user or another user when `:userId` is present

### `pages/Settings.jsx`

- Mixes per-user preferences and admin-only controls
- Admin users can enable multi-user mode from Settings
- When multi-user mode is enabled, admin users see a **Users** tab
- The **Users** tab supports creating users, editing usernames/roles/passwords, activating/deactivating users, deleting other users, and forcing first-login password changes
- Includes:
  - profile name editing
  - avatar picker
  - theme picker
  - app language, primary/display price source, currency, and portfolio-basis controls
  - owner-photo preference and delete-all owner-photo action
  - cross-language price/image fallback preferences and digital-set visibility
  - public-profile, public-handle, and optional public-value controls
  - TCGdex sync-language selection for admins
  - Telegram configuration and guided Gemini/OpenAI-compatible scanner setup
  - administrator-only tested custom scanner models and server setup summary
  - per-user scanner diagnostics consent and explicit stored-data deletion
  - sync controls
  - auth mode toggle
  - backup and restore
  - Community sections for contributors and supporters

The supporter section calls the installation's own
`/api/community/supporters` endpoint once whenever the Community view is
entered. It retains the last valid result only in the browser's in-memory query
cache, hides that cache while the entry fetch is pending or after it fails, and
performs no timed, background, or focus-based refreshes. Above the supporter
cards it shows the supporter count, combined donation count, and exact
known-currency totals grouped by currency; mixed-currency records are identified
instead of being combined into a misleading amount. The browser never calls the
public website registry directly, and no supporter projection is persisted by
the installation.

### Collection and Card Lists

`pages/Collection.jsx` owns filtering, strict CSV import, export actions,
printing-detail tags, and private owner-card photos. Owner photos are loaded
through authenticated endpoints and can be preferred over catalogue artwork in
the current user's UI.

`pages/Binders.jsx`, `pages/BinderDetail.jsx`, `pages/DeckEditor.jsx`, and
`pages/DeckCompare.jsx` share the Card List domain. Physical Binders and Real
Decks allocate exact owned copies from one capacity pool. Planned Binders and
Planned Decks store requirements without reserving inventory. The Deck editor
adds validation, composition, shortage, legality, probability, duplicate, and
planned/real conversion tools. See [`CARD_LISTS.md`](CARD_LISTS.md).

### Search, Pokédex, products, and trades

`pages/CardSearch.jsx` keeps free text and advanced filters in the URL. Filters
cover number, set, category, type, subtype, rarity, HP range, artist, rule text,
language, sort, and pagination. Text matching is accent-insensitive; card-code
queries such as `PFL 001` use the same route. The Pokédex detail screen applies
the compatible `dex_id` filter in Grouped mode and `pokedex_entry_id` in
Separate forms mode when it loads matching printings.

`pages/Pokedex.jsx` derives owned/missing species or form entries from collection data and
supports search, generation/region, and status filters. It uses German species
metadata when the app language is German and English metadata otherwise.
`pages/PokedexSpecies.jsx` reuses the card grid for grouped or exact-form printings and related-form navigation.

`pages/Products.jsx` covers sealed/opened product lifecycle, batch entry,
images and Cardmarket links, linked pulls, sales/flat gains, and realized versus
unrealized results. `pages/Trades.jsx` previews values and records editable
incoming/outgoing card and cash changes while keeping the collection in sync.

### Public profile routes

The `/u` route tree is intentionally outside `ProtectedRoutes`. It consumes
only `/api/public/*` serializers, not authenticated collection responses. The
admin master switch and trainer opt-in gate the public profile. Collection
Binders and Decks require individual opt-ins, while the Wishlist uses a
profile-wide Private, Trade matches, or Public choice. The separate
value-visibility preference controls whether prices are returned.

`PublicProfileShell` and `TabNav` provide one Binders/Wishlist/Decks profile
layout. Public card grids use `CardListGallery` in catalogue-only public mode;
public Decks reuse `DeckCompositionBar`, `DeckValidationPanel`, and
`DeckAnalyticsPanel`. The public mode never invokes owner-photo or authenticated
collection-card presentation, and Deck comparison is omitted because it depends
on private user-owned lists. Reverse-proxy installations must also allow the narrow route set in
[`REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH.md`](REVERSE_PROXY_AUTH.md).

## Card UI

### Shared card system

Feature pages import the public API from `frontend/src/components/card-system`. Its high-level components are `CardDisplay`, `CardRow`, `CardIdentity`, `CardDialog`, `CardLegend`, and `CardStack`.

The system centralizes card structure, borders, image handling, badges, ownership and unavailable states, responsive behavior, and keyboard/touch interactions. Pages supply data, layout, and actions rather than assembling their own card visuals.

Approved `CardDisplay` variants include `grid`, `carousel`, `ranking`, `selectable`, `artwork`, and `compact-artwork`. A development-only component gallery is available at `/__card-system`.

See [`CARD_SYSTEM.md`](CARD_SYSTEM.md) for usage, design tokens, review guidance, and the contributor-friendly process for proposing a new shared variant.

`CardItem.jsx`, `UnifiedCard.jsx`, and the low-level state components remain implementation details of this public system and should not be imported by feature pages.

`ImageZoomOverlay.jsx` provides the shared click/touch artwork inspection used
outside scanner comparison. It supports zoom, pan, keyboard close, and preserves
the normal Card Display click contract. Printing-detail badges and the unified
primary-price presentation are supplied through the same shared card state so
feature pages do not invent competing labels.

### `pages/CardSearch.jsx`

- Main search UI for locally cached TCGdex cards and matched custom cards
- Supports select mode for search results
- Can select the current page or all matching search results
- Bulk-add sends selected cards to `/api/collection/bulk-add` with default quantity `1`, condition `NM`, no variant, no purchase price, and the card language
- Bulk-add success toast reports added, updated, and failed counts

### Scanner and review inbox

`components/UnifiedCardScanner.jsx` is the capture-only entry point. It supports the native device camera and gallery uploads, stages one or more photos, allows per-photo individual recognition overrides, and includes an optional positioning guide beside **Take photo**. Every submission enqueues a persistent job and routes to the same review inbox, including a one-photo scan.

`pages/ScanQueue.jsx` and `components/ScanReview.jsx` show job progress, retry countdowns/reasons, sanitized source photos, ranked candidates, failed items, individual retry, dismissal, and collection-add review. The navigation badge counts outstanding items. A confirmed candidate id is sent when resolving an item so opted-in diagnostics can be labelled with human-reviewed ground truth.

Opening a candidate starts a full-screen linked pan/zoom comparison (`CardZoomModal`, `useLinkedZoom` in `components/ScanReview.jsx`): scroll or click to zoom toward the pointer (up to 6x), drag to pan, arrow keys step through the other candidates for that photo while the zoom/pan position is preserved, and Escape backs out of the zoom before closing the modal. Candidate images load progressively (`useCandidateFullImage`): a blurred thumbnail stand-in shows instantly and crossfades to the full-resolution image once decoded, sourced from the backend's candidate-image cache with a CDN fallback. Thumbnails are prefetched as soon as a photo's candidates arrive; the high-resolution image prefetches on hover/touch (`usePrefetchMatchImages`, `prefetchImage`). Accepting a match from the zoom view routes through the same add-to-collection modal used elsewhere — there is no auto-accept — and atomically adds and resolves the scan before automatically opening the next unresolved photo in the job (`openNextReview` in `ScanQueue.jsx`), so a failed request stays on the current review and a batch can be cleared without returning to the list between cards. A candidate whose printed set total contradicts the recognized photo shows a ⚠ badge in the grid. Once an item is resolved it collapses to a compact green-check row (recognized name and number), re-expandable as a read-only review on click, so a long batch stays scannable without allowing the same scan to be added twice.

Rate-limit countdowns distinguish daily quota from ordinary throttling. Queued
photos remain available only while their item needs review and are deleted on
confirmation/dismissal; jobs expire after 14 days. Before an atomic
add-and-resolve request, the frontend retains the source Blob in memory. When
the confirmed card has no catalogue or custom fallback artwork, it then makes a
best-effort upload into the user's private collection-card photo storage.
Failure to retain that optional copy never rolls back the collection add.

### External matcher (pokescan)

When the backend has `EXTERNAL_MATCHER_URL` configured (see `docs/POKESCANNER-PLAN.md`), three extra surfaces appear; all of them hide themselves otherwise:

- **Debug panel** (`components/MatcherDebugPanel.jsx`, mounted in `ScanItemPanel`): for items whose `recognized._source === "external"` (or `has_matcher`) it loads `GET /api/cards/recognize/jobs/{job}/items/{item}/matcher` and shows the source photo with the detected quad as an SVG overlay (viewBox = `geometry.image_size`, so it scales with the rendered box), the rectified plane (fetched as an authenticated blob), the decision state badge, hint, truthy flags as chips (incl. `twin.ambiguous`), script/orientation/card-back score, language evidence, number reading + verdict, the ranked candidates with score bars and margins (compare/add reuse the existing review and resolve-and-add flow), and a stacked per-stage timings bar. Collapsible, open by default for external items; a 404 hides it silently. Pure helpers live in `utils/matcherDebug.js`.
- **Scanner Settings** (`ExternalMatcherView` in `components/ScannerSettingsCard.jsx`): health (online/down, commit, bundle, gallery, uptime) and a per-language, searchable supported-sets table from `GET /api/settings/scanner/external`, plus the note that ja/zh-tw hits are returned but not synced. Hidden on 401/403/404 or `configured: false`; a 503 shows it as down. The query is shared and cached (`hooks/useExternalMatcherStatus.js`).
- **Scanner modal** (`UnifiedCardScanner.jsx`): an en/de **Card language** toggle sent as the `session_lang` form field on `POST /api/cards/recognize/jobs`, persisted in `localStorage` (`scanner_session_lang`) and defaulting to the app language when it is en/de, else `en`. A **Live scanner** link appears when the build sets `VITE_LIVE_SCANNER_URL`.

Strings live in the `matcher` namespace of `i18n/en.js` and `i18n/de.js`; other locales fall back to English.

The AI/Card Scanner section in `pages/Settings.jsx` shows **Share scanner diagnostics** as an available control only when the server configured writable `SCAN_TRACE_DIR` storage. The toggle is off by default. Turning it off stops future tracing without deleting existing data; the adjacent confirmed delete button removes all stored diagnostics for the current user and remains available through the stable cleanup path when new collection is disabled.

## API Layer

`frontend/src/api/client.js` is the central Axios client.

Notable frontend API bindings include:

- auth mode and force-password endpoints
- GitHub community endpoints
- social endpoints for leaderboard / compare / achievements
- selective backup download via `downloadBackup(include)`
- Card List/Deck allocation and conversion endpoints
- product lifecycle, linked-card ledger, and trade endpoints
- Pokédex, profile, and anonymous public-profile endpoints
- authenticated collection-card photo and printing-detail-tag endpoints

## Removed / No Longer Documented

- No eBay integration in the current frontend
- No grading UI in the current frontend
