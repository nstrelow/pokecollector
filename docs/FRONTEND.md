## Auth Flow

### `AuthContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`.

Responsibilities:

- Fetches `/api/auth/mode` on startup
- In single-user mode, attempts `/api/auth/me` without a token
- In multi-user mode, restores user from stored token if present
- Exposes:
  - `user`
  - `loading`
  - `multiUser`
  - `loginUser(token, userData)`
  - `updateCurrentUser(updates)`
  - `logout()`

Security-related behavior:

- `logout()` removes token and user from local storage
- Logout forces a full page reload to clear cached React Query data and prevent cross-user leakage
- Axios also clears auth state on `401`

### Login and Password Change

- `pages/Login.jsx` is only used when `multiUser === true`
- `App.jsx` defines an inline `ForcePasswordChangeScreen`
- If `user.must_change_password` is true, normal app routes are blocked until `/api/auth/me/force-password` succeeds

## Settings & Localization

### `SettingsContext`

Defined in `frontend/src/contexts/SettingsContext.jsx`.

Provides:

- `settings`
- `updateSettings(updates)`
- `t(path)`
- `language`
- `priceDisplay`
- `pricePrimary`
- `pricePrimaryField`
- `currency`
- `currencySymbol`
- `exchangeRate`
- `formatPrice(eurAmount)`
- `formatUsdPrice(usdAmount)`

Notes:

- Translation bundles are loaded from `frontend/src/i18n/` and wired in `SettingsContext`
- UI languages include all supported TCGdex language codes, plus Swedish. Regional variants such as `es-mx`, `pt-br`, `pt-pt`, `zh-tw`, and `zh-cn` are selectable from a compact dropdown in Settings.
- Legacy stored `zh` settings are normalized in the frontend to `zh-cn` for display
- USD display uses exchange rates from the backend Frankfurter endpoint

### `useTheme`

Defined in `frontend/src/hooks/useTheme.js`.

- Stores the selected theme in `localStorage`
- Applies theme via `data-theme` on `document.documentElement`
- Available themes:
  - `default`
  - `fire`
  - `water`
  - `grass`
  - `electric`
  - `psychic`
  - `dragon`
  - `dark`
  - `fairy`

## Navigation

### Home / Portal Navigation

- `pages/HomeScreen.jsx` is the main portal view
- The app now uses a compact navigation pattern with 6 primary portal items on the home screen
- Secondary sections are organized with grouped tabs on individual pages

### `TabNav`

Defined in `frontend/src/components/TabNav.jsx`.

- Reusable horizontal tab bar
- Marks a tab active if the current pathname equals or starts with the tab path
- Used by pages such as `Dashboard`, `Collection`, `Wishlist`, `Binders`, `Analytics`, `Products`, `Leaderboard`, and `Achievements`

### `Layout` and `AppNav`

- `components/Layout.jsx` wraps protected routes
- `components/AppNav.jsx` shows the current page title and multi-user logout control

## Key Screens

### `pages/Login.jsx`

- Multi-user login screen
- Supports quick return to the last signed-in user via `lastUser` and `lastUserAvatar` in local storage

### `pages/Leaderboard.jsx`

- Social ranking view for multi-user mode
- Uses `TabNav`

### `pages/Compare.jsx`

- Side-by-side trainer comparison
- Route parameter: `userId`

### `pages/Achievements.jsx`

- Shows achievements for current user or another user when `:userId` is present

### `pages/Settings.jsx`

- Mixes per-user preferences and admin-only controls
- Admin users can enable multi-user mode from Settings
- When multi-user mode is enabled, admin users see a **Users** tab
- The **Users** tab supports creating users, editing usernames/roles/passwords, activating/deactivating users, deleting other users, and forcing first-login password changes
- Includes:
  - profile name editing
  - avatar picker
  - theme picker
  - app language dropdown and currency controls
  - TCGdex sync-language selection for admins
  - Telegram configuration and guided Gemini/OpenAI-compatible scanner setup
  - administrator-only tested custom scanner models and server setup summary
  - per-user scanner diagnostics consent and explicit stored-data deletion
  - sync controls
  - auth mode toggle
  - backup and restore
  - Community sections for contributors and supporters

The supporter section calls the installation's own `/api/community/supporters` endpoint once whenever the Community view is entered. It retains the last valid result only in the browser's in-memory query cache, hides that cache while the entry fetch is pending or after it fails, and performs no timed, background, or focus-based refreshes. Above the supporter cards it shows the supporter count, combined donation count, and exact known-currency totals grouped by currency; mixed-currency records are identified instead of being combined into a misleading amount. The browser never calls the public website registry directly, and no supporter projection is persisted by the installation.

## Card UI

### Shared card system

Feature pages import the public API from `frontend/src/components/card-system`. Its high-level components are `CardDisplay`, `CardRow`, `CardIdentity`, `CardDialog`, `CardLegend`, and `CardStack`.

The system centralizes card structure, borders, image handling, badges, ownership and unavailable states, responsive behavior, and keyboard/touch interactions. Pages supply data, layout, and actions rather than assembling their own card visuals.

Approved `CardDisplay` variants include `grid`, `carousel`, `ranking`, `selectable`, `artwork`, and `compact-artwork`. A development-only component gallery is available at `/__card-system`.

See [`CARD_SYSTEM.md`](CARD_SYSTEM.md) for usage, design tokens, review guidance, and the contributor-friendly process for proposing a new shared variant.

`CardItem.jsx`, `UnifiedCard.jsx`, and the low-level state components remain implementation details of this public system and should not be imported by feature pages.

### `pages/CardSearch.jsx`

- Main search UI for locally cached TCGdex cards and matched custom cards
- Supports select mode for search results
- Can select the current page or all matching search results
- Bulk-add sends selected cards to `/api/collection/bulk-add` with default quantity `1`, condition `NM`, no variant, no purchase price, and the card language
- Bulk-add success toast reports added, updated, and failed counts

### Scanner and review inbox

`components/UnifiedCardScanner.jsx` is the capture-only entry point. It supports the native device camera and gallery uploads, stages one or more photos, allows per-photo individual recognition overrides, and includes an optional positioning guide beside **Take photo**. Every submission enqueues a persistent job and routes to the same review inbox, including a one-photo scan.

`pages/ScanQueue.jsx` and `components/ScanReview.jsx` show job progress, retry countdowns/reasons, sanitized source photos, ranked candidates, failed items, individual retry, dismissal, and collection-add review. The navigation badge counts outstanding items. A confirmed candidate id is sent when resolving an item so opted-in diagnostics can be labelled with human-reviewed ground truth.

Photos are downscaled in the browser before upload (`utils/scannerImages.js`) to the same 2048px longest edge the backend applies anyway — 2.09MB to 0.47MB across a 37-photo sample. It is best effort and every failure path sends the original, and it does not crop to the card, because the backend's detector is what the accuracy figures were measured against. With "Scanner v2 (Beta)" on, a candidate tile represents one artwork and carries its other language printings as selectable chips beneath it (`CandidatePrintingPicker`), plus a corner percentage that is a measured probability rather than distance arithmetic (`CandidateConfidenceBadge`); both render nothing for provider-scanner candidates, which send neither field.

Opening a candidate starts a full-screen linked pan/zoom comparison (`CardZoomModal`, `useLinkedZoom` in `components/ScanReview.jsx`): scroll or click to zoom toward the pointer (up to 6x), drag to pan, arrow keys step through the other candidates for that photo while the zoom/pan position is preserved, and Escape backs out of the zoom before closing the modal. Candidate images load progressively (`useCandidateFullImage`): a blurred thumbnail stand-in shows instantly and crossfades to the full-resolution image once decoded, sourced from the backend's candidate-image cache with a CDN fallback. Thumbnails are prefetched as soon as a photo's candidates arrive; the high-resolution image prefetches on hover/touch (`usePrefetchMatchImages`, `prefetchImage`). Accepting a match from the zoom view routes through the same add-to-collection modal used elsewhere — there is no auto-accept — and atomically adds and resolves the scan before automatically opening the next unresolved photo in the job (`openNextReview` in `ScanQueue.jsx`), so a failed request stays on the current review and a batch can be cleared without returning to the list between cards. A candidate whose printed set total contradicts the recognized photo shows a ⚠ badge in the grid. Once an item is resolved it collapses to a compact green-check row (recognized name and number), re-expandable as a read-only review on click, so a long batch stays scannable without allowing the same scan to be added twice.

Rate-limit countdowns distinguish daily quota from ordinary throttling. Photos remain available only while their item needs review and are deleted on confirmation/dismissal; jobs expire after 14 days.

The AI/Card Scanner section in `pages/Settings.jsx` shows **Share scanner diagnostics** as an available control only when the server configured writable `SCAN_TRACE_DIR` storage. The toggle is off by default. Turning it off stops future tracing without deleting existing data; the adjacent confirmed delete button removes all stored diagnostics for the current user and remains available through the stable cleanup path when new collection is disabled.

## API Layer

`frontend/src/api/client.js` is the central Axios client.

Notable frontend API bindings include:

- auth mode and force-password endpoints
- GitHub community endpoints
- social endpoints for leaderboard / compare / achievements
- selective backup download via `downloadBackup(include)`

## Removed / No Longer Documented

- No eBay integration in the current frontend
- No grading UI in the current frontend
